<h2>Spring 2015 - Kelly Anne Pipe</h2>

## Catalog Description

The class will be a mixture of web design theory and practical front-end techniques. Students are expected to have experience hand-coding websites using HTML and CSS, a basic understanding of using Git, and be familiar with basic principles of design such as color and typography. Topics covered will include: usability, accessibility, git, Javascript/jQuery, designing for content management, and using Wordpress as a CMS. By the end of this course, students should have a solid understanding of the web design industry and modern web design techniques.

## Course Prerequisite

Students are required to have knowledge of hand-coding HTML and CSS.  A passing grade in COM372 is a prerequisite for this course. Students who have not taken COM372 but who have experience with hand-coding HTML and CSS may be written into this course at the discretion of the professor.

Twitter: @kellygrape

Phone: 610-660-1672

I am a full-time administrator member at SJU, typically on campus from 8:30am – 4:30pm. I am often at my desk, but do have meetings (and occasionally leave to eat lunch). You are encouraged to visit my office to ask questions, share concerns, or just say hi. Before stopping by, please email at **kpipe@sju.edu**. This is especially true if you need extended help. For short queries, you can message me via Google Chat (**kellyanne.martin@gmail.com**).

When emailing me, keep in mind that—depending on the day and email volume—it might take me 48 hours to respond. If I haven’t responded to you in 48 hours, please email me again. I won’t be offended or bothered: Things can get lost in digital transit, and I want to make sure your questions are answered in a timely fashion.

My office is in Bala 175 - the last SJU office right before the 7-11 across from Lannon Hall.  My official office hours are on Wednesdays from 3:00pm – 4:00pm (I will do my best to not schedule meetings during this time); however, I’m frequently in my office.

## Required Texts

There is one required text for this class

* Duckett, Jonathan (2014). *JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development*.  Wiley

    * [Purchase on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647)

    * There is an older version of this book.  Do *not* purchase that version (so, don’t purchase a used copy unless you’re sure it’s the current version).

I will also ask you to use several specific pieces of free software (we will install these, together, in class):

* We will edit code using [Brackets](http://www.brackets.io/), a free software available for both Mac and PC

* Everyone will store and submit files their work at [Github](http://www.github.com/)

* We will preview our coded pages in Google Chrome, utilizing a local server that we create using [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/) or [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

Finally, you will be required to purchase web hosting & a domain. Web hosting is available very inexpensively for students for $25 a year at [http://www.reclaimhosting.com](http://www.reclaimhosting.com)  We will discuss this in class.

## Course Overview & Learning Objectives

There is absolutely no way that you will be able to learn everything about web design in a single course.  Therefore, my goal for this course is to help you to teach yourself.  You will be expected to take the initiative in your own learning.

In this course, you will be practicing new techniques and testing your creative skills.  You are encouraged to try and fail.  Do not be discouraged by your failures.  I will do my best to help you understand where you may have gone wrong, and how you can approach fixing it.  You must enter the class with curiosity, perseverance, and a desire to experiment (and thusly break things). A collective spirit of creativity and invention is one of the web’s most important gifts, and channeling that spirit is one of this course’s most primary goals.

There will be times when I do not know the answers.  I have been doing web design for years, professionally for more than 5 years.  I still do not know everything about web design and development.  My hope is that, by the time this course is finished, you will have enough knowledge about the web design process that you are able to face new challenges throughout your professional career.  

More traditionally, upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Code a website from scratch utilizing HTML and CSS

2. Explain **progressive enhancement** and how it applies to web design and development

3. Understand how to utilize a **web framework (**such as Bootstrap or Skeleton) to speed development

4. Describe what **Javascript and jQuery** are, have a basic fluency in common interactive elements, and have a basic understanding of how to use these scripting languages

5. Have competency in Wordpress as a **content management system**

6. Evaluate Wordpress **themes and plugins**, install and integrate plugins and themes as needed

7. Understand how to **create a basic Wordpress theme**, as well as customizing pre-made themes.

## Class Requirements

The final grade will be determined by performance on the following projects. The specific details of each project will be included on the project’s assignment sheet and discussed in class. You must complete each assignment to earn a passing grade!

### HTML & CSS Project (25%) 

### Javascript / jQuery Project (25%) 

### Wordpress Project (25%) 

These three projects will be assigned through the course of the semester, and will reinforce and showcase what you have learned.

### Codecademy Exercises (10%)

Throughout the course, you will work through the [jQuery](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery) and [Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) tracks on CodeCademy. This will help you to better practice your Javascript / jQuery skills.

### Class Blog / Experiments (10%) 

Each week you will be assigned a number of discussion questions / topics about which you will be require to write short blog entries.  This blog will be your way to process what you are learning, share your thoughts, and share your process of learning.  A word count and due dates will be discussed with each writing topic. 

### Informal Projects, Class Prep, & Attendance (5%)

This category will be assessed based both on your blog entries, contributions to github, and your attendance to and in participation in class activities. Specific criteria will be discussed and negotiated in class. (Beyond class time, you will have to devote 3-4 hours per week to reading and prepping; however, you should do that in tandem—and expect it to overlap with—any coding work).

## Policies

### Attendance, Attention, & Participation

As this course is highly interactive and practice/discussion-driven, your success is absolutely tethered to your presence and participation. The course will move quickly, and each successive meeting will build upon the concepts of the previous. Missing a class puts you at a serious disadvantage in terms of the larger semester arc.

In Short: Like a math course, each of our meetings adds a new skill that builds upon those previously learned. By missing one class, you will be very behind for the next.

Please come to class on time, prepared, having completed the assigned reading and writing, and ready to contribute to class discussions, to listen seriously and respectfully to the thoughts of others, and to participate in all in-class activities. Lateness is also unacceptable; if you arrive late to class or leave early, you can be marked as absent. Only three absences are permitted, and these should be used for illness or emergencies (i.e. this does not mean three absences plus absences for illness etc.). Each absence after your third will result in a .25 deduction from your final grade—making, for example, a 3.25 a 3.0. After the sixth absence, you will fail the class (a grade of FA). Your primary responsibility is to be in class and fully present.

Beyond mere presence, however, a successful course requires student participation. Students are expected to come to class on time, prepared, having completed the assigned reading and writing, and ready to work in the lab, to listen seriously and respectfully to the thoughts of others, and to participate in all in-class activities. I strongly urge you to attend every class, as most of the work done in class is necessary for successful completion of the course.

### Course Website

The course website for this class can be found at [http://www.professorpipe.com/spring2015](http://www.professorpipe.com/spring2015). You should get in the habit of checking this regularly as I will post suggestions and thoughts about the readings here, as well as links to other things that might interest the class. The syllabus can be found here as well, and any changes to the syllabus will be posted here.

### A Note on Technology

Although a majority of the tools we will be using in class are open source and free, they aren’t all web based or easily portable. We do have lab computers on which you can work; however, you will probably find it easier to use your own computer, if possible. Bringing your own computer and configuring it during class and lab sessions might save you time later.

Should you need to use additional materials: In the IT office in the basement of Merion Hall (directly below our classroom), COM students have access to a variety of audio/visual equipment. Check out time is 48 hours.

### Digital Etiquette

Many of the assignments throughout the semester will require participation in online spaces. Students should work to preserve the same atmosphere of respect and consideration that occurs in the classroom. Disagreements may arise and consensus is not always possible (indeed disagreements are productive). However, name calling, harassing, flaming, trolling etc. is antithetical to the goals of this course.

### Grading

Specific grading criteria for each assignment will be discussed in class, but in general: I will evaluate your work on a 4.0 grading scale, where an outstanding performance yields a 4.0 (an A), good performance yields a 3.0 (a B), fair performance yields a 2.0 (a C), and work that simply meets the minimum requirements yields a 1.0 (a D). I will use an assignment-specific framework to evaluate each project, and each of those frameworks will be detailed on the assignment sheet and available to you before you submit your final draft.

Unless it is cleared with me before the deadline, late work will be penalized at 1 grade point per day late. So an A assignment becomes a B if submitted a day late, etc. If you feel that your project is going awry or that you won’t be able to meet a deadline, please contact me before the deadline. Depending on the project and the context, I can sometimes help with deadline pressure—if contacted in advance. After the deadline, the penalty stands.

The semester grade breakdown (based on a percentage of total available points) follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>B+: 89-87%</td>
    <td>C+: 79-77%</td>
    <td>D+: 69-67%</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A: 100-94%</td>
    <td>B: 86-84%</td>
    <td>C: 76-74%</td>
    <td>D: 66-64%</td>
    <td>F: 59-0%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A-: 93-90%</td>
    <td>B-: 83-80%</td>
    <td>C-: 73-70%</td>
    <td>D-: 63-60%</td>
    <td></td>

### University Policies

**Academic Honesty:** There are a few basic rules regarding the use of information in this course:

* If you use the language of your source, you must quote it exactly, enclose it in quotation marks, and cite the source—even (and especially) in your blog posts. This is called a direct quotation. A direct quotation is either enclosed in quotation marks or indented on the page. If you omit part of the wording, use an ellipsis (three periods, four if necessary for punctuation to indicate the omission). In any case, several words in succession taken from another source constitute direct quotation and must be acknowledged.

* A paraphrase employs source material by restating an idea in an entirely new form that is original in both sentence structure and word choice. Paraphrased material also needs to be cited—either by parenthetical citation, in-sentence attribution, or hyperlink. Taking the basic structure from a source and substituting a few words is an unacceptable paraphrase and may be construed as plagiarism. Creating a new sentence by merging the wording of two or more sources is also plagiarism. The penalty for plagiarism is an automatic Fail for this class and a letter of notification to the Committee on Discipline.

* When attaching or inserting any type of media (image, sound, etc) into your work, that media should be used and cited in a manner compliant with the work’s copyright or creative commons license. In most instances, you should seek out media that has a creative commons license or has been released to the public domain.

In short: If you use media, information, or ideas that are not yours and not common knowledge, you must cite a source. I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the [University’s Academic Honesty Policy](http://hawkcentral.sju.edu/ics/support/kbanswer.asp?deptID=16171&amp;task=knowledge&amp;questionID=95).

**Disability Support:** In accordance with state and federal laws, the University will make reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.  For those who have or think that  you may have a disability requiring an accommodation (learning, physical, psychological) should contact Services for Students with Disabilities, Room G10, Bellarmine Hall, 610-660-1774 (voice) or 610-660-1620 (TTY) as early as possible in the semester for additional information and so that an accommodation, if appropriate, can be made in a timely manner.  You will be required to provide current (within 3 years) documentation of the disability.

 

For a more detailed explanation of the University’s accommodation process, as well as the programs and services offered to students with disabilities, please go to[ http://www.sju.edu/int/studentlife/studentresources/sess/ssd/index.html](http://www.sju.edu/int/studentlife/studentresources/sess/ssd/index.html) .  If you have difficulty accessing the information on-line please contact Services for Students with Disabilities at the telephone numbers above.
