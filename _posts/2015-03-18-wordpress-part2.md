##Class Goal

There is no in-class session today, but please follow the activity below.  You will be using a Wordpress theme called "Layers" to create an engaging website.  I have provided you with web space to do this.

##Activity

1) Log in to your Wordpress installation.  I have built you each Wordpress instances specifically for this activity.  **Do not use your own installation, or your class blog**. I have sent you each an individual email with instructions for accessing this installation.  This is a **full wordpress installation**, with no customizations.  You have full administrative control on this site.

2) Install the theme 'Layers'.  This is not available via the theme repository.  You will have to [download it](http://www.layerswp.com/) and install it yourself.  When you download Layers, it will be saved to your computer as a **zip file**.  [Here are instructions on installing a wordpress theme via a zip file](http://goatcloud.com/2014/03/06/how-to-install-a-wordpress-theme-from-a-zip-file/).

3) Choose one of the topics below, and create at least **three pages** related to that topic.  If you want to do a different topic, feel free.  **The specific copy (paragraphs of text) that you use does not matter as much as your ability to create a nice, functional website**.

###Topics

- A small website about your spring break
- A website for the Perch
- A website for a bakery
- A website for Greens to Go
- A website about the NCAA Tournament
- As always, another topic of your choosing is perfectly acceptable

###What Should My Site Feature

You should strive to emulate one of the following demos from the Layers website:

- [Business Website Demo](http://sites.layerswp.com/acquire/)
- [Bakery Demo](http://sites.layerswp.com/baking/)

You should:

1. Incorporate a menu that links to your home page and your two other pages
2. Use two different, contrasting fonts - there is a way that you can set the heading font and the body font in Layers.  It incorporates Google Web Fonts for you!
3. Use bold images or blocks of color.
4. Incorporate a content or image slider somewhere in the website.
5. Utilize three to five distinct content sections on the home page.  You can see an example of this on the Bakery site - the slider at the top, followed by a small content section with the three cupcakes in columns, then the section with the addons, followed by the footer.
6. Include a "Contact Us" form on one of the pages
7. At least one of your pages, aside from the home page, should utilize the 'Page Builder' template ([how to change the page template](https://en.support.wordpress.com/pages/page-attributes/)).  This will enable the page builder similar to the front page.

###Resources You Can Use

- [A Video Tutorial on Using Layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWXsQd9h1UQ)
- [Find free stock photos](http://finda.photo/)
- [More places to find stock photos that don't suck](https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b)
- [All kinds of filler text](http://meettheipsums.com/)

The [Layers website](http://www.layerswp.com/) is a great place to start for information, and here are two news articles about Layers that you might find interesting.

- [From today, the way you build WordPress sites will change. Say hello to Layers](http://blog.oboxthemes.com/from-today-the-way-you-build-wordpress-sites-will-change-say-hello-to-layers/)
- [Thoughts on Site Building, WordPress and Layers](http://blog.oboxthemes.com/thoughts-on-site-building-wordpress-and-layers/)

###What is the point of the exercise?

Wordpress is a really interesting tool, and different themes and plugins really can totally change the Wordpress experience.  I want you to act like professional web designers, and explore this tool as way to understand a little more about what Wordpress can do.  Through utilizing the tools in Layers, you will get the experience of using widgets, using page templates, and problem solving through experimentation.

##Assignments

**This activity will be due next Wednesday before class** (so, you have an entire week to work on it).  I expect that you will have made significant progress on this before next Monday's class.  **You will be graded on this, with the grade going towards a portion of Project #3**.  Your grade will be based on your ability to follow instructions and deliver a site according to the client specifications (the list of things that I included under "What should my site feature").  You should also keep working on Project #2.

**Grade**

- A website is delivered on time (3 points)
- Student successfully installed the Layers Wordpress theme (2 points)
- Website successfully represents the chosen topic (3 points)

- Website utilizes bold imagery and colors (3 points)
- Homepage features three to five distinct content sections (5 points)
- Website utilizes at least two different fonts (3 points)
