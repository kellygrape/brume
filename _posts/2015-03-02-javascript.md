##Class Goal

We will be finishing up our program from last week, and discussing pre-built jquery plugins.

##Lesson Plan

Work together to finish up our to-do application from last week.

##jQuery Plugins

Plugins are scripts that extend the functionality of the jQuery library.  There are thousands of plugins, some good, some bad.  Chapter 11 in your book talks about how you could build some of the common functionality offered by plugins yourself.

##Example Plugins

- [Lettering.js](http://letteringjs.com/) "A jQuery plugin for radical web typography"
- [jQuery Scrollpath](http://joelb.me/scrollpath/) Set a cool scrolling path so your content flies all over the screen
- [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) and [Impress.js](http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/title) - make your own presentations in JS
- [Fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) - a lightbox script that allows you to zoom images and html content.
- [Full Calendar](http://fullcalendar.io/) - a full sized calendar
- [Formstone](http://formstone.it/) - Lots of different, little UI things
- [Flexslider](http://flexslider.woothemes.com/) - A carousel for images


Every plugin is different, and should be implemented according to the instructions the plugin author supplies.  Let's look at implementing Flexslider.
