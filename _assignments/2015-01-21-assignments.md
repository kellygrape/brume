##To Do

1. Change the *Document Root* for your MAMP / XAMPP install.  This will make it easier to find your files and keep them organized. You will have to restart your sever after you do this!!  That is usually done by just hitting "stop" and "start" on the tool

- [MAMP Instructions](http://documentation.mamp.info/en/documentation/mamp/#3.4-Apache)
- [XAMPP Instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408/make-xampp-apache-serve-file-outside-of-htdocs) - The top rated solution has three options.  Do the *third* one.  The file they're talking about editing - you should be able to edit it using either Notepad or your normal code editor.


2. Create a *file* inside the root of your local site.  Name it *index.php*.  Use this basic [HTML template](https://github.com/com372-14/page-template/blob/master/index.html) to create your first page.

3. Create a *folder* inside the root of your local site.  Name it *wordpress*.  You will install Wordpress into this folder.

4. Follow instructions for [installing Wordpress on your local machine using MAMP.](http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-install-wordpress-and-multisite-locally-on-macos-x-with-mamp/)  If you are using XAMPP, you can get [instructions for installing Wordpress with XAMPP here](http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-install-wordpress-locally-for-pcwindows-with-xampp/).

Feel free to utilize any media you wish, including images or video.  Incorporating media is not a requirement.
