##Due Date

All assignments are due before the start of our next class.

##To Read

In your Javascript book, read all of Chapter 1.  There are three parts to Chapter 1.

By the end of your reading, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

- What are some common things that Javascript can be used for (pages 6-7)
- What is a script?  What are some things that a script can be compared to?  How can writing out steps or creating a flowchart help you to code? (Please do not memorize how to use a flowchart ... just be familiar with the concept!)
- What is the difference between an object and a property?  If a car is an object, what would some properties of a car be?
- What is the difference between a method and an event?  Again, with a car as an object, what could some events and their related methods be?
- How does a browser read a web page?  **This is very important**.  You should be able to take a small HTML page and break it out into a tree like on page 41.
- What is HTML used for?  What is CSS used for?  What is Javascript used for?  What is Progressive Enhancement?
- What is one way to add Javascript to a page?  How is this similar to adding CSS to a page?  How is it different? (These last two questions aren't specifically addressed in your book, you will have to think about it.)


##To Do

- There is an activity on page 46 - 49 of your book.  Do this exercise.  The folder you create ('c1') should be placed in your document root.

###Quiz Warning - there will be a quiz on what you have read.

##Project #1

[Project Number 1](2015-02-11-project1.html), worth 20% of your final grade, is due on March 2, 2015.
