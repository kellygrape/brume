##Due Date

All assignments are due before the start of our next class.

##To Read

- Take [this CSS Quiz](http://flukeout.github.io/).  How did you do? 

- Look through some Wordpress themes ([Wordpress.org Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/) and [Wordpress.com Themes](https://theme.wordpress.com/) - some of the Wordpress.com themes are also able to be self-installed.  If you hover over the theme preview, then click the Blue Button with the theme name, you'll come to a page that looks [like this](https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/sela/).  If available to download from the themes directory, there will be a link to do so.) and pick a few that you like.  Install them locally or make a note of them to install later, and play around with configuring them.

- Work through the [CSS Layout Tutorial](http://learnlayout.com/)

- Do the entirety of the [Hack Design Lesson #15](https://hackdesign.org/lessons/15).  **This is due next Monday**. 

##Writing Topics

Answer the following questions as a post on your class-created Wordpress blog.  All three questions can be answered in a single post.  This post should be a reasonable length (about 250 words).

Feel free to utilize any media you wish, including images or video.  Incorporating media is not a requirement.

- Look through the [top rated pens of 2014 on Codepen](http://codepen.io/2014/popular/).  Embed (if you can) or link to two or three that you find interesting. 
 
  - What do you like about them?  
  - What do you find interesting about them?  
  - To the best of your understanding, what is happening in the pen - what code is being used and what is that code doing?
