##Due Date

All assignments are due before the start of our next class.

##To Do

Continue experimenting with your HTML5 Boilerplate and layout work.

Buy the Javascript book from our class syllabus.  You will have an assigned reading from this next week.

##To Read

Check out the [9 basic principles of responsive web design](http://blog.froont.com/9-basic-principles-of-responsive-web-design/) - this is short and has lots of graphics.  Do you recognize some of these responsive design patterns?  You should be familiar with the difference between **Relative and Static units**, have a familiarity with **what breakpoints are**, and have a concept of what adding a wrapper with a **max width** will do to your content.

Read the following from Lesson 15 & 22 in Hack Design.  These readings will help you to recognize mobile design patterns, and help you review what we learned in today's class.

- [Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) (I know, you've read it before!  Just wanted to remind you it exists.  Do you understand anything about this article more now than you did before?  How has your understanding of this topic changed?)
- [Responsive Navigation Patterns](http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/responsive-nav-patterns/)
- [Multi-Device Layout Patterns](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1514)
- [Mobile Patterns](http://www.mobile-patterns.com/)

**If you're interested**, look into the [User Experience lessons](https://hackdesign.org/lessons/9), [Defining & Expanding User Experience](https://hackdesign.org/lessons/11), and [Understanding the User in User Experience](https://hackdesign.org/lessons/12).  User Experience is a huge area of web and interaction design, and salaries for UX experts are quite high.

##Writing Topics

1) What do you think design is?  (seriously, answer this in a few sentences).

2) Now, read [this article](https://ia.net/know-how/learning-to-see).  Now, has your answer from before changed?

3) Scan through the list of UX Myths.  Read at least the titles of each one.  Choose one and respond to it.  My suggestions are below, but you can choose whatever you would like.
