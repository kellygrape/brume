##To Read

In your Javascript book, read all of Chapter 2.

##To Do

- In CodeCademy, complete the first lesson of the [Javascript track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript).  You only have to do the "Getting Started with Programming" part.  This is not as short as previous codecademy lessons, so give yourself some time to complete it.
- Continue working on Project #1

##Project #1

[Project Number 1](2015-02-11-project1.html), worth 20% of your final grade, is due on March 2, 2015.
