### Finish Project #2

[Project Number 2](2015-03-04-project2.html), worth 20% of your final grade, is due on April 1, 2015.  This is a large project, so do not leave it to the last minute.

### Extra Credit

- Listen to or read the transcript of [The Web Ahead Episode 100](http://thewebahead.net/100).
- Read [Zen and the Art of Wearable Markup](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/jeffrey-zeldman/2015-march-21)
- After listening and reading, write (in your class blog that you have been using for all your other writing assignments) a 500-750 word essay about your thoughts on the future of web design / how we will experience web pages moving forward.

You will receive an extra 10 points on your project #2 grade.  This is due (if you would like to earn the extra credit) by 11:59pm Monday, April 6, 2015 (changed from the original due date of Friday, April 3).
