##Due Date

All assignments are due before the start of our next class.

##To Read

In your Javascript book, read pages...

**86-127**

  - This is a review of functions, objects, and a basic overview of the Window and the Document object.  We went over these things in class, but I glossed over some information that is covered more in-depth in the book.
  - I don't need you to memorize all the ways to create functions or objects, or all the methods and properties of the Window / Document object, but you should be starting to become familiar with these concepts and how to use them.
  
**128-135**

  - This is OPTIONAL but does cover some other useful objects in Javascript.  You'll see the substring method on page 128, which you've used in your Codecademy lessons.
  
**136-139**

  - Javascript's Date() object is useful for finding the date.  :)
  
**184-187**

  - This talks about the DOM, which is the Document Object Model.  Chapter 5 as a whole is dedicated to the ways that JS can access and modify the DOM.  We will be doing most of our DOM Manipulation using jQuery, so we will skip this chapter for now.

##To Do

- In CodeCademy, complete the THIRD lesson of the [Javascript track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript).  We are skipping the Choose Your Own Adventure exercise because I found it tedious.  Feel free to complete it if you really want.
- In CodeCademy, complete the first lesson of the [jQuery track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery).
- Finish this [lesson about jQuery from Thinkful](http://www.thinkful.com/learn/intro-to-jquery) (we started this in class).
- Continue working on Project #1

##Project #1

[Project Number 1](2015-02-11-project1.html), worth 20% of your final grade, is due on March 2, 2015.
