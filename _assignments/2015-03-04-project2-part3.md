##Design Project

**You do not need to create any code for this section**.  All designs can be done in whatever tool you are comfortable using.  You will be graded based on your creativity and your attention to detail – these are fairly open-ended, so you may make your own creative choices.

Read this [design brief](http://briefbox.me/design-brief/italian-restaurant-style-tile/) and create two different Style Tiles for this company.  Alternately, create two style tiles for a real company or organization that you feel a connection to.

### About Style Tiles
 
[Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/) are a way to showcase design ideas and elements before fully designing a web page.

There is a [photoshop template](http://styletil.es/downloads/Style_Tile_Template.psd.zip) available for creating a style tile, if you wish to use it.
 
If you want to, you can try this in [HTML / CSS](http://webstiles.namanyayg.com/)

###What Should I Submit?

You will submit via email two graphics (or, if you’re feeling especially excited, make them into web pages) that incorporates a basic style look and feel for your company.  Your style tiles should include, at minimum,
 
- A color scheme
- Typography treatments for headings (main headings, subtitles), body text, and any special areas
- A sample of a call to action button
- Examples of how you might incorporate social links (icons? Text? Both?)
- Sample imagery (can be as a thumbnail) and textures that might work to give the site some personality

Your style tiles should be neatly presented.  You may use the template provided on the Style Tiles website or put together your own layout

###How will you grade this?

This is worth 25% of Project 2.  25 Points total broken into the points below.

##Delivery 

Submit your graphics via email.  If you made a web page, upload it to github as a repository and send me the link.  I will not grade your code if you choose to make a web page - just the styles themselves
